Main code is [here](https://github.com/GrahamSH-LLK/java-proj-ssh/blob/main/app/src/main/java/ssh/App.java) and [here](https://github.com/GrahamSH-LLK/java-proj-ssh/blob/main/app/src/main/java/ssh/ClientWrapper.java)
### Was your project successful? If not, explain.
Yes, my project was successful. I was able to create a program that lets me connect to any server running a SSH server and execute commands and get input.
### What hurdles did you experience during your project? How did you
overcome them?
I had a lot of trouble getting Java libraries using gradle to work. I had to do a lot of research to get Gradle to install the ssh library in addition to JavaFX. In addition, I learned a lot about how Java error handling works.
### Did you learn anything new during this project?
I learned a lot about how SSH works behind the scenes while debugging, in addition to using JavaFX to create a GUI for my app.
### Would you change your project? If so, what would you change?
I would make the GUI look a little better. I also would figure out how to make the text output scrollable.
### What did you change about your project from the initial description to
the final product?
I decided not to do CLI because I thought it would be more interesting to learn JavaFX and not use Swing.
